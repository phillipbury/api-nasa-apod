# NASA API â€” Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)

This project calls the NASA APOD API and outputs the media data for today and the previous 8 days.

Each image can be enlarged by clicking on the image, and a modal image will display. Associated with each image are two link. The "Image Source" link directs to the image URL on NASA's website, and the "APOD Source" link directs to the NASA APOD webpage pertaining to the image.
